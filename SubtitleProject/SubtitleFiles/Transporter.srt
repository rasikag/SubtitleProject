I bet they like
Evian in Fallujah.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,683
Well, they don't really care
for sparkling water.

how I earn my living.

- And what you mean by that?
- Oh, nothing.

they don't tell.

what I can't quite figure

is why one of them would want
to kill your accountant.

worked with previously

presumably mean nothing

the deal never changes.

Dad, time to go.

1054
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,081
Really?

1055
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,521
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Mmm, Mmm.

Cause I'm a fool for you

1058
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,363
You know I speak the truth

1059
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,165
Whatever you say or do

1060
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,406
You know they're doing
another job.

1061
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,723
Yeah, taking on a Russian crime
lord is more of a suicide mission.

1062
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,247
Imagine how horrible your life has
to be to try something like that.

1063
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,326
I've seen some horrible things
in some horrible places.

1064
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,404
Being sold into prostitution
with death as your only out.

1065
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,923
That's about
as bad as it gets.

1066
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,170
The question is, what are
you gonna do about it?

1067
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,241
Me?

1068
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,924
There's no one
else in the car.

1069
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,524
I don't have
to do anything.

1070
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,730
I'm gonna drop you home,
ditch the car at a chopper,

1071
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,644
go to Paris for a bit until
things cool down, you know.

1072
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,690
That doesn't sound
like the man I raised.

1073
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,450
Dad, stop.

1074
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,005
All right,
stay within the lines,

1075
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,167
watch everything play out, that's
exactly what a fobbit would do.

1076
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,449
Look, my entire life, I've tried
to do the right thing, you know.

1077
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,726
Maybe I wasn't a spy
like you,

1078
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,609
but I served that fool.

1079
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,331
What did it get me?

1080
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,529
Shit I didn't deserve.
You said it yourself.

1081
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,969
It doesn't mean you stop
doing the right thing.

1082
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,482
Send me a postcard
from Paris.

Don't tell me you don't recognize my voice.
It hasn't been that long.

What do you want?

1088
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,009
Well, I want to make a deal.

1089
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,726
You have some people I want,
three of them to be exact,

1090

Go ahead, say hello.

on the phone.

01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,325
KARASOV: Well,
he's resting now

1095
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,767
and frankly, I think
he's giving you bad advice.

1096

Anything happens to him...

1097
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,210

Come on, Frank, I know you.

1098
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,691
You were a good soldier.

1099
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,683
And you'll do what
a good soldier always does.

1100
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,969
You'll follow the orders, So
listen to me very closely.

your father alive again,

he took my dad.

of you and so is my dad.

now with the ledger.

need you to do one for me.

a choice?

Don't lie to me.

1123
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,283
Karasov assumes that there
is only three of us

1124
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,601
and that's what he is looking for.
Don't you think?

1125
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,405
This is why we always
kept someone separate.

1126
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,729
So one of us could get away.
That was our deal.

1127
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,491
Let's get
your father back.

about what happened?

is a real step up

a military convoy truck.

You know, you brought this
on yourself, Frank.

1140
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,770
Everyone in your platoon played
ball, they made a lot of money.

1141

It would have been easier

1142
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,884
if you just went along
with the rest, you know.

1143
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,601
I wasn't there to make money.
I was there to fight a war.

bring the ledger?

1152
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,889
Now where's my dad?

1153
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,450

1157
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,801
You tell us.

1158
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,681
What's that supposed
to mean?

1159
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,727
You called
the meeting.

1160
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,086
I didn't call anything.

1161
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,650

What's this about?

1162
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,808
Well, for one, I found the
people who stole from you.

1163
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,723
Right, And he's
right there.

1164
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,406
Listen, I'm getting pretty
sick of you both accusing me

1165
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,527
of something
I didn't do.

1166
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,523
As a matter of fact, I brought
these people here to kill them.

I work for him.

He told me to
rob you and I did.

1171
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,811
We called you here because
he has your money.

1172
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,761
Let her talk.

1173
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,169
ANNA: There's no way we're
taking the fall for this.

1174

01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,481
Have him show you, Ask him to
show you the bank account.

1177
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,044
I'm not showing
anybody shit.

for a long time.

1179
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,480
Maybe you should.

1180
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,405
You'll see
he has every penny.

1181
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,481
Shut up!

1182
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,881
It's not part of your plan,
this, is it, Junior?

1183
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,881

I have just over 120 million.

Grab that tablet right there.

1185

Show you the account, You're
gonna see for yourself.

1186
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,767
That's a fair start.

1187
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,684

Come on.

to your money.

being less critical?
